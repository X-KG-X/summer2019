# MySQL installation
- install homebrew

# after installing homebres and mySql, need modification

=> restart mySql : brew services restart mysql

All of the listed steps below are commands you will run in your Terminal.
Use homebrew to install MySQL.
--brew install mysql
Use homebrew to start your MySQL Server as a  "service", meaning it will run in the background and allow connections.
--brew services start mysql
Now with MySQL installed, you have access to some new command line tools. Run the following command to set the MySQL root user's password to "root".
--mysqladmin -u root password "root"
Connect to the sql server by typing: 
--mysql -u root -p
After entering your mysql password ('root' in this case), you can run your sql queries directly in the terminal.  For example
--show databases;  - shows all the database schema
--use [database_name]; - replace [database_name] with the database_name you want to access.
--show tables; - shows all the tables available in the database

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost'
  IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password
  BY 'root';
